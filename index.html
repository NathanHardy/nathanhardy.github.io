		My name is Nathan Hardy. I may just look like an ordinary guy (albeit in somewhat fancy dress), but in actuality, I am the King of the Space Walruses - a title which I have held for over 4000 years. I attend the University of Louisville College of Business, and expect to graduate May 2015 with degrees in Computer Information Systems (concentration in Web Development) and World Domination. One time I went sky diving, and did so well that I landed on the moon.

		This is a picture of me with a member of my favorite band, <a href="http://protomen.com/lightupthenight/">The Protomen.</a> I like video games, cars, and most of all, computers. My dream is to make video games, either as an independent developer, or for Nintendo or Valve, but it seems unlikely that I will be able to do much with that, since I'm just barely good enough at programming to pass my classes (I'm better with SQL and VMware, though).
